D → Smart Market Questions
What keeps them awake at night, eyes open, staring at the ceiling:
Dr. Reed is kept awake by the intellectual challenges of her research, the complexities of supporting her students, and the broader societal misconceptions about ADHD. She worries about the students who fall through the cracks, those who don't have access to effective support. She also contemplates the next big breakthrough in cognitive science that could genuinely transform lives. On a personal level, she reflects on her own children's development, particularly her ADHD-diagnosed child, and how best to equip them for success in a neurotypical world. Her mind is a constant hum of ideas, research questions, and strategic planning.
What are they secretly afraid of in life:
Her deepest fear is that despite all her efforts, the stigma and misunderstanding surrounding ADHD will persist, preventing individuals from receiving the support they need to thrive. She fears that her research or advocacy won't make a significant enough impact, and that future generations will continue to struggle with preventable challenges. On a personal level, she fears not being able to fully support her own children in navigating their unique neurodevelopmental paths.
What are the angry about, and who are they angry at:
Dr. Reed is profoundly angry at the systemic failures within educational and healthcare institutions that often misdiagnose, misunderstand, or inadequately support individuals with ADHD. She is angry at the perpetuation of harmful myths and stereotypes about ADHD that lead to self-blame and underachievement. She is also frustrated by the proliferation of unscientific, ineffective 


solutions that prey on vulnerable individuals. Her anger is a driving force for her advocacy and research.
Top 3 frustrations they feel every day:
1. The slow pace of systemic change and the resistance to implementing evidence-based practices in education and mental health.
2. Encountering individuals who dismiss ADHD as a lack of willpower or a behavioral problem, rather than a neurological difference.
3. The constant need to filter through a vast amount of misinformation and unscientific claims in the ADHD support space.
Biggest secret desire in life:
Her biggest secret desire is to live in a world where neurodiversity is not just tolerated, but celebrated and understood, where every individual, regardless of their brain wiring, has the tools and support they need to reach their full potential. She yearns for a future where her research leads to widespread, accessible, and effective interventions that truly transform lives.
Built-in bias to how they make decisions:
Dr. Reed is heavily biased towards evidence-based, scientifically validated solutions. She is highly skeptical of anything that lacks rigorous research or makes unsubstantiated claims. She values transparency, data, and a deep understanding of underlying mechanisms. She is also biased towards solutions that empower individuals to understand and work *with* their brains, rather than simply suppressing symptoms. She seeks out tools that integrate seamlessly into existing workflows and offer long-term, sustainable benefits.
Common words or language unique to them:
"Neurodiversity," "executive function," "dopamine dysregulation," "cognitive load," "scaffolding," "evidence-based practice," "translational research," "stigma reduction," "self-regulation," "metacognition."
Top 3 complaints about existing solutions:
1. "Many so-called 'ADHD apps' are just generic productivity tools rebranded. They don't integrate actual brain science or offer adaptive strategies that account for the fluctuating nature of ADHD symptoms. They're not truly 'smart' or personalized."
2. "There's a lot of well-meaning advice out there, but it often lacks the scientific rigor or practical application needed for real, sustainable change. I need tools that are built on a deep understanding of neurobiology and cognitive psychology, not just anecdotal success stories."
3. "Most solutions focus solely on task management, ignoring the crucial role of motivation, emotional regulation, and physical well-being in ADHD. A truly comprehensive tool needs to address the whole person, integrating wellness hacks and motivational science into the core functionality."

E → Going Deep
Top 3 Dominant Negative Emotions:
1. Frustration: At the slow pace of progress in ADHD understanding and support, and the persistence of misinformation.
2. Impatience: With ineffective or unscientific approaches to ADHD management.
3. Concern: For individuals, especially students, who are struggling without adequate support or understanding.
Top 3 Dominant Positive Emotions From Solving This Problem:
1. Validation: The profound satisfaction of seeing her research and advocacy translate into tangible, positive outcomes for individuals.
2. Optimism: A strong belief in the potential for neurodivergent individuals to thrive with the right tools and understanding.
3. Empowerment: The joy of equipping others with the knowledge and strategies to take control of their own lives and reach their potential.
Top 3 Beliefs They Hold About The World:
1. Neurodiversity is a natural variation of the human brain, and society should adapt to support it, not pathologize it.
2. Science and research are the most powerful tools for understanding and improving the human condition.
3. Every individual deserves the opportunity to reach their full potential, and effective support systems are crucial for this.
Biggest Lifestyle Desire:
Her biggest lifestyle desire is to live a life of profound impact, where her work as a researcher and advocate directly contributes to a more inclusive and understanding world for neurodivergent individuals. She wants to see her children and her students thrive, leveraging their unique strengths, and to experience the deep satisfaction of knowing she has helped build a future where ADHD is understood, supported, and even celebrated.

F → Purchasing Habits
Top 3 Decision Triggers:
1. Scientific Validation: Strong evidence-based claims, peer-reviewed research, or endorsements from reputable neuroscientists/psychologists.
2. Comprehensive Integration: Solutions that address multiple facets of ADHD (task management, motivation, wellness) in a cohesive, intelligent way.
3. User Empowerment: Tools that teach users *how* their brain works and *why* certain strategies are effective, fostering self-understanding and long-term habit change.
Prior Purchases For This Pain:
Dr. Reed has invested in various academic subscriptions, specialized software for data analysis and knowledge management (e.g., Obsidian, Zotero), and premium versions of focus-enhancing apps (e.g., Freedom). She also frequently purchases books and attends conferences on ADHD, cognitive science, and educational psychology. She has also purchased and experimented with various apps for her children, seeking the best fit for their needs.
Price Tolerance For Offer:
Dr. Reed is willing to pay a premium for a truly effective, scientifically-backed solution. For A-D-H-WHAT?, she would likely start with the **$5/mo Student Plan** to evaluate its core features and user experience, especially for her own children. However, she would quickly consider the **$15/mo Focus Pro Plan** if the AI-guided study blocks, adaptive coaching, and integration features prove to be genuinely innovative and effective. She views such tools as an investment in long-term well-being and academic success, for herself, her students, and her children.
Time Horizon Of Solution:
She seeks long-term, sustainable solutions that foster genuine habit change and self-regulation, not just temporary fixes. She wants a tool that can adapt and grow with the user, providing support from middle school through college and beyond. She is looking for a foundational tool that can become an integral part of a neurodivergent individual's support system.
