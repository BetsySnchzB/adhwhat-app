D → Smart Market Questions
What keeps them awake at night, eyes open, staring at the ceiling:
Maya is kept awake by the intellectual puzzle of her own brain. She understands the mechanisms of executive dysfunction, the dopamine pathways, and the impact of stress on cognitive function, yet she struggles to apply this knowledge to her own life. She worries about her future in academia, about whether she can sustain the rigorous demands of graduate school if she can't consistently manage her current workload. She feels the pressure to perform, to live up to her intellectual potential, and the fear that her internal struggles will always hold her back. She's constantly analyzing her own failures, trying to pinpoint the exact moment things went wrong, and devising new strategies that often fall apart by morning.
What are they secretly afraid of in life:
Her deepest fear is that despite all her knowledge and effort, she will never truly master her own mind. She's afraid of being perpetually stuck in a cycle of intellectual understanding without practical application, of being a perpetual student of productivity without ever becoming truly productive. She fears that her brain's unique wiring will always be a barrier to the consistent, high-level performance she desires, and that she'll never achieve the academic or professional success she knows she's capable of.
What are the angry about, and who are they angry at:
Maya is angry at the pervasive gap between scientific understanding and practical, accessible solutions for neurodivergent individuals. She's frustrated by the generic, one-size-fits-all productivity advice that ignores the neurological realities of ADHD. She's also angry at the societal pressure to conform to neurotypical standards of productivity, which often leads to self-blame and burnout for people like her. She directs her anger at the lack of truly intelligent, adaptive tools that leverage neuroscience to help people with executive dysfunction.
Top 3 frustrations they feel every day:
1. The inability to consistently translate her extensive knowledge of productivity and cognitive science into effective daily habits.
2. The constant battle against internal distractions and the struggle to maintain focus on tasks she knows are important.
3. The feeling that she's always one step behind, despite her best efforts, and the mental exhaustion from constantly trying to optimize her own brain.
Biggest secret desire in life:
Her biggest secret desire is to achieve a state of effortless flow and consistent, high-quality output, where her intellectual curiosity and analytical mind can thrive without the constant drag of executive dysfunction. She yearns for a life where her brain is her ally, not her adversary, allowing her to pursue her academic and research passions with sustained focus and deep satisfaction.
Built-in bias to how they make decisions:
Maya is heavily biased towards evidence-based solutions and those that are rooted in scientific understanding (psychology, neuroscience). She's skeptical of anecdotal evidence or overly simplistic advice. She values tools that offer customization and adaptability, recognizing that her brain works differently. She's also drawn to solutions that promise to help her *understand* her own processes better, not just blindly follow instructions. She seeks intellectual validation for her choices.
Common words or language unique to them:
"Executive function," "dopamine regulation," "cognitive load," "neuroplasticity," "flow state," "meta-cognition," "evidence-based," "bio-hacking for the brain," "mind-body connection."
Top 3 complaints about existing solutions:
1. "Most productivity apps are just glorified to-do lists. They don't integrate the *why* behind the struggle, or offer science-backed strategies for actually *overcoming* executive dysfunction. They're just a digital planner, not a coach."
2. "I've tried all the generic 'focus' apps, but they don't account for the unique way an ADHD brain gets distracted or motivated. They're not smart enough to adapt to my fluctuating attention or hyperfocus tendencies."
3. "Wellness apps are great for general stress, but they don't connect the dots between sleep, hydration, movement, and *actual academic performance*. I need something that shows me how these elements directly impact my ability to focus and get work done, not just vague 'feel good' advice."

Maya is a highly motivated and intelligent student who is acutely aware of her productivity challenges and actively seeks solutions. Unlike Liam, she has moved beyond simply identifying the problem; she understands the underlying cognitive and neurological mechanisms at play (executive dysfunction, attention regulation) and is actively searching for tools and strategies that are scientifically informed and tailored to her unique brain. She has tried many generic solutions and found them lacking because they don't address the root causes of her ADHD-related struggles. She is in the 'Solution Aware' stage because she knows that solutions exist (e.g., specific productivity techniques, mindfulness, cognitive behavioral strategies), but she hasn't yet found the *perfect* tool or system that consistently works for *her*. She is looking for an intelligent, adaptive, and evidence-based productivity coach that can bridge the gap between her theoretical understanding and her practical execution, allowing her to finally achieve consistent focus, organization, and academic success. Her decision-making is driven by efficacy and scientific validity, making her a discerning prospect for a specialized ADHD-friendly productivity app.
