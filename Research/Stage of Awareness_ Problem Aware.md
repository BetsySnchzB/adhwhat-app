C → Why Are They:
Main Personality Traits:
Liam is intelligent, creative, and possesses a sharp wit. He's highly empathetic and genuinely wants to succeed, but struggles immensely with executive dysfunction. He's easily distracted, prone to hyperfocus on non-essential tasks, and has a deep-seated fear of failure despite his capabilities. He's a procrastinator, often paralyzed by the sheer volume of tasks, leading to last-minute rushes and subpar work. He's also quite self-critical, internalizing his struggles as personal failings rather than symptoms of ADHD. He values authenticity and intellectual curiosity but often feels like he's not living up to his own potential.
5 Major Values They Hold:
1. Authenticity: Values genuine connections and honest self-expression.
2. Intellectual Curiosity: Driven by a deep desire to understand how things work and explore new ideas.
3. Competence: Wants to be seen as capable and intelligent, especially in his chosen field.
4. Contribution: Desires to make a meaningful impact, even if small, through his work or ideas.
5. Freedom: Craves autonomy and the ability to pursue his interests without feeling constrained by rigid structures or overwhelming obligations.
2 Major Life Victories:
1. Getting accepted into a competitive Computer Science program at university, defying expectations from some teachers who doubted his organizational skills.
2. Successfully completing a complex personal coding project (a small game mod) that required sustained effort and problem-solving, proving to himself that he *can* focus when deeply interested.
2 Major Life Failures:
1. Failing a crucial first-year calculus exam due to procrastination and inability to start studying until the last minute, leading to immense self-doubt and academic probation.
2. Consistently missing deadlines for group projects, leading to strained relationships with teammates and a reputation for unreliability, despite his best intentions.

D → Smart Market Questions
What keeps them awake at night, eyes open, staring at the ceiling:
Liam is kept awake by a swirling vortex of anxieties: the looming deadlines he's already behind on, the fear of disappointing his parents who are investing in his education, the shame of past failures replaying in his mind, and the overwhelming feeling that he's constantly forgetting something important. He worries about his future, about whether he'll ever be able to hold down a job or manage a career if he can't even manage his daily tasks. The silence of the night amplifies his internal chaos, making him feel utterly alone in his struggle.
What are they secretly afraid of in life:
His deepest fear is that he's fundamentally broken, that his brain is wired incorrectly, and that he'll never be able to achieve his potential. He's terrified of being perpetually stuck in a cycle of procrastination, underachievement, and self-reproach. He fears that his ADHD will define him, preventing him from building a stable, successful, and fulfilling life, and that he'll always be seen as the "smart kid who just couldn't get it together."
What are the angry about, and who are they angry at:
Liam is angry at himself for his perceived lack of discipline and willpower. He's angry at his brain for not cooperating, for the constant distractions, and for the mental fog that descends when he tries to focus. He's also subtly angry at a system (academic and societal) that seems designed for neurotypical brains, making him feel like an outsider constantly playing catch-up. He resents the simplistic advice often given to him ("just try harder," "be more organized") because it completely misunderstands the neurological reality of his struggles.
Top 3 frustrations they feel every day:
1. The inability to start tasks, even when he knows they are urgent and important, leading to a crushing sense of guilt and wasted time.
2. Getting easily sidetracked by irrelevant details or new interests, derailing his entire day and leaving him feeling unproductive.
3. The constant mental exhaustion from trying to force himself to focus, only to feel his mind drift away, leading to burnout and despair.
Biggest secret desire in life:
His biggest secret desire is to feel a sense of effortless control over his time and tasks, to consistently follow through on his intentions, and to experience the quiet satisfaction of sustained productivity. He yearns for a life where his intelligence and creativity are not overshadowed by his executive dysfunction, where he can consistently perform at his best and feel a deep sense of accomplishment and peace.
Built-in bias to how they make decisions:
Liam is heavily biased towards novelty and immediate gratification. He's drawn to anything that promises a quick fix or an exciting new approach, often abandoning existing systems before giving them a fair chance. He also tends to over-optimize for perceived efficiency, spending more time researching the "perfect" tool or method than actually doing the work. He's also biased towards solutions that acknowledge and understand the unique challenges of ADHD, rather than generic productivity advice.
Common words or language unique to them:
"ADHD paralysis," "doom pile," "brain fog," "hyperfocus," "executive dysfunction," "time blindness," "analysis paralysis," "shiny object syndrome," "the struggle is real."
Top 3 complaints about existing solutions:
1. "They're designed for neurotypical brains. They assume I can just 'make a to-do list and stick to it,' but my brain doesn't work like that. They don't account for the constant distractions or the difficulty with initiation."
2. "Most productivity apps are just glorified checklists. They don't *help* me focus or motivate me when I'm stuck. They just remind me of everything I'm *not* doing, which makes the guilt worse."
3. "The 'wellness' advice out there is so generic. 'Get more sleep,' 'eat healthy.' Yeah, I know! But how do I actually *do* that when my entire routine is a mess? I need practical, actionable steps that account for my unique challenges, not just platitudes."

E → Going Deep
Top 3 Dominant Negative Emotions:
1. Guilt: A pervasive, heavy feeling stemming from missed deadlines, unfulfilled potential, and the constant sense of letting himself and others down.
2. Overwhelm: A paralyzing sensation caused by the sheer volume of tasks, the inability to prioritize, and the feeling of being constantly behind.
3. Frustration: A simmering anger at his own brain, at the world, and at the perceived unfairness of his struggles, often leading to outbursts of self-criticism.
Top 3 Dominant Positive Emotions From Solving This Problem:
1. Relief: The profound sense of lightness and freedom that comes from consistently meeting deadlines and feeling in control.
2. Confidence: A growing belief in his own capabilities and a reduction in self-doubt, leading to a more positive self-image.
3. Calm: A quiet, steady peace that replaces the constant internal chaos, allowing him to think clearly and act intentionally.
Top 3 Beliefs They Hold About The World:
1. The world is largely designed for neurotypical individuals, making it an uphill battle for those with ADHD.
2. Success requires consistent effort and follow-through, which he deeply struggles with despite his intelligence.
3. There must be a better way to manage his life and harness his potential, but he just hasn't found it yet.
Biggest Lifestyle Desire:
His biggest lifestyle desire is to live a life of intentionality and flow, where he can pursue his passions, excel in his studies, and maintain healthy relationships without the constant internal battle against executive dysfunction. He wants to feel competent, capable, and at peace, with enough mental bandwidth to enjoy life beyond his academic struggles.

F → Purchasing Habits
Top 3 Decision Triggers:
1. Impending Crisis: A major deadline looming, a failing grade, or a significant conflict with a professor/teammate due to missed commitments.
2. Peer Recommendation: Hearing about a tool or method that genuinely helped someone else with similar struggles, especially if they also have ADHD.
3. Novelty/Hope: The promise of a new, innovative solution that explicitly addresses ADHD challenges, offering a glimmer of hope for a breakthrough.
Prior Purchases For This Pain:
Liam has a graveyard of abandoned productivity tools: various planner apps (Todoist, Notion), generic meditation apps, focus timers (Pomodoro apps), and even physical planners and notebooks. He's also bought several books on productivity and ADHD management, most of which remain unfinished.
Price Tolerance For Offer:
He is highly price-sensitive due to being a student. He's willing to pay for a solution that genuinely works, but it needs to be affordable for a student budget. He'd prefer a freemium model with a compelling free tier, or a subscription around $5-10/month, especially if there's a student discount. He's wary of high upfront costs or long-term commitments without proof of efficacy.
Time Horizon Of Solution:
He needs a solution that provides immediate relief and visible progress, but also promises long-term, sustainable change. He's looking for something that can help him *now* with his current assignments, but also teach him habits and strategies that will serve him throughout his academic career and beyond. He's tired of quick fixes that don't address the root cause of his struggles.
