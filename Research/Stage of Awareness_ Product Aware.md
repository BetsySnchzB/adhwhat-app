C → Why Are They:
Main Personality Traits:
Alex is highly creative, empathetic, and possesses a quirky sense of humor. They are deeply passionate about their interests and can achieve incredible feats when hyperfocused. However, they struggle significantly with task initiation, organization, and time management, especially for less stimulating academic tasks. They are self-aware of their ADHD (diagnosed in middle school) and actively seek strategies to manage it, but often feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of advice and tools available. They are a visual thinker and learn best through hands-on experience and creative expression. They value authenticity, creativity, and personal growth, but often feel like their brain is working against them, leading to frustration and self-doubt. They are trying to navigate the complex transition from high school to college, a period that amplifies their executive dysfunction challenges.

2. Authenticity: Strives to be true to themselves and values genuine connections.
3. Growth: Committed to personal development and learning from experiences.
4. Connection: Values strong friendships and a sense of belonging in communities.
5. Self-Acceptance: Learning to embrace their neurodivergence rather than fight it.
2 Major Life Victories:
1. Getting accepted into a prestigious summer art program, which required a portfolio submission and demonstrated their ability to complete a long-term creative project.
2. Successfully advocating for themselves at school to receive accommodations for their ADHD, demonstrating self-awareness and proactive problem-solving.
2 Major Life Failures:
1. Missing the deadline for a major scholarship application because they kept putting off writing the essay, despite having a strong academic record and needing the financial aid.
2. Having a significant art project for a class completely fall apart at the last minute due to poor time management and underestimating the scope of work, leading to a lower grade than expected and immense disappointment.

D → Smart Market Questions
What keeps them awake at night, eyes open, staring at the ceiling:
Alex is kept awake by the swirling anxieties of college applications, impending deadlines, and the fear of not being able to manage the increased workload in university. They worry about their future, about whether they can truly succeed in a demanding academic environment, and if their ADHD will always be a barrier. They replay past failures – missed deadlines, forgotten assignments – and feel a deep sense of inadequacy. The quiet of the night often brings a cascade of racing thoughts, making it impossible to shut off their brain.
What are they secretly afraid of in life:
Their deepest fear is that they will never be able to consistently perform at their potential, that their ADHD will always sabotage their efforts, and that they will ultimately fail to achieve their dreams of a fulfilling career and independent life. They are terrified of being perpetually overwhelmed, disorganized, and unable to follow through, leading to a life of unfulfilled potential and constant stress.
What are the angry about, and who are they angry at:
Alex is angry at the traditional education system for its rigid structures that don't accommodate neurodivergent brains. They are frustrated by generic productivity advice that feels dismissive of their genuine struggles. They are also angry at themselves for their perceived lack of willpower and for falling into old patterns of procrastination, despite knowing better. They resent the constant need to 


justify their struggles to others who don't understand ADHD.
Top 3 frustrations they feel every day:
1. The inability to start important tasks, especially those that are boring or overwhelming, leading to a cycle of guilt and avoidance.
2. The constant battle against distractions, both internal and external, which derails their focus and productivity.
3. The feeling of being constantly behind, with a never-ending to-do list that seems to grow no matter how hard they work.
Biggest secret desire in life:
Their biggest secret desire is to have a brain that feels like a reliable partner, not a chaotic adversary. They yearn for a life where they can effortlessly translate their creative ideas into tangible outcomes, consistently meet their goals, and feel a sense of calm and control over their daily life. They want to be able to trust themselves to follow through, without the constant need for external pressure or last-minute panic.
Built-in bias to how they make decisions:
Alex is biased towards solutions that are visually appealing, customizable, and offer a sense of playfulness or creativity. They are drawn to tools that explicitly mention ADHD and are designed with neurodivergent users in mind. They value peer recommendations from other ADHD individuals and are more likely to try something if it has a strong community aspect. They are also biased towards tools that offer a free trial or a low-cost entry point, as they are on a student budget.
Common words or language unique to them:
"Executive dysfunction," "dopamine snacks," "brain weasels," "time blindness," "task paralysis," "body doubling," "shiny object syndrome," "the wall of awful."
Top 3 complaints about existing solutions:
1. "Most productivity apps are so boring and sterile. They feel like a chore to use, which just adds to the task paralysis. I need something that’s engaging and doesn’t feel like another thing I have to force myself to do."
2. "I’ve tried using a bunch of different apps, but they don’t talk to each other. I have my to-do list in one place, my calendar in another, and my notes somewhere else. It’s just more chaos to manage."
3. "The reminders are so generic. They just pop up and I immediately dismiss them. I need something that actually grabs my attention and motivates me in the moment, not just another notification to ignore."

They want to be able to thrive in college and beyond, confident in their ability to manage their ADHD and build a life that is both successful and fulfilling.

F → Purchasing Habits
Top 3 Decision Triggers:
1. Specific Feature Alignment: Discovering a tool that directly addresses a specific pain point, like visual organization, customizable reminders, or integration with their existing workflow.
2. Peer Endorsement: Seeing other ADHD students or creators they admire genuinely recommend and use a specific app.
3. Free Trial/Low-Cost Entry: The ability to try out the core features of an app without a significant financial commitment, allowing them to see if it actually works for their brain.
Prior Purchases For This Pain:
Alex has purchased premium versions of various apps (e.g., Notion templates, focus timers), but often abandons them when they become too complex or fail to hold their interest. They have also bought physical planners, whiteboards, and art supplies with the intention of getting more organized, with mixed results.
Price Tolerance For Offer:
As a high school student with a limited budget, Alex is highly price-sensitive. They are accustomed to free or low-cost apps. They would be willing to pay for the **$5/mo Student Plan** of A-D-H-WHAT? if the basic features prove to be effective during a free trial. The **$15/mo Focus Pro Plan** would be a significant investment, but they might consider it if they find the AI-guided study blocks and Notion integration to be game-changers for their college prep.
Time Horizon Of Solution:
They need a solution that can help them *now* with their immediate challenges (college applications, final exams), but also one that can grow with them as they transition to college. They are looking for a tool that can provide both immediate relief and long-term support, helping them build sustainable habits for the future.
