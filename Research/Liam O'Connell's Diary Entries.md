## Liam O'Connell's Diary Entries

### Entry 1: Before Using the Product

*October 26th, 2025*

The clock on my laptop mocks me, its digital glow a cold, unfeeling reminder of how little time I have left. It’s 2 AM, and this damn Computer Science project, the one I swore I’d start last week, is still a blank canvas in my mind. A crushing wave of **guilt** washes over me, heavy and suffocating, like a lead blanket. It’s not just about this project; it’s about all of them. The calculus exam I bombed last year, the group presentation where I was practically a ghost, the countless promises I’ve made to myself and broken.

My desk is a battlefield of half-hearted attempts: a crumpled energy drink can, a textbook open to a page I haven’t truly absorbed, a sticky note with a single, accusing word: “CODE.” My brain feels like a thousand browser tabs open at once, each screaming for attention, none of them letting me focus on the one that matters. The **overwhelm** is a physical sensation, a tightening in my chest, a dizzying spin in my head. Where do I even begin? The sheer *volume* of what needs to be done is a mountain I can’t even see the peak of, let alone climb. Every potential starting point feels like a trap, leading to another rabbit hole of distraction.

And the **frustration**… God, the frustration. It’s a hot, prickly sensation under my skin, a silent scream trapped in my throat. I’m angry at myself, at this brain that refuses to cooperate, that constantly sabotages my best intentions. It’s like trying to drive a car with a mind of its own, veering off course at every shiny billboard, every fleeting thought. I *know* I’m smart. I *know* I’m capable. But this invisible wall, this executive dysfunction, it just *stops* me. It’s infuriating. I see my peers, effortlessly churning out code, collaborating, planning their futures. And here I am, staring at a blinking cursor, feeling like a broken machine. The fear that I’m fundamentally flawed, that I’ll never truly get it together, is a cold, sharp knife twisting in my gut. Another all-nighter looms, another desperate scramble, another promise to myself that this will be the last time. But I know, deep down, it won’t be. Not unless something drastically changes. And I’m so, so tired of fighting myself.




### Entry 2: During Their First Use of Product

*November 1st, 2025*

I finally caved. After another near-miss with a project deadline, the sheer desperation gnawed at me until I downloaded A-D-H-WHAT?. The initial setup was… surprisingly not terrible. The colors are actually kind of cool, not like those sterile, corporate-looking apps that scream ‘work.’ But even as I started, a familiar wave of **skepticism** washed over me. How many times have I been here? How many ‘miracle’ apps have I downloaded, only for them to become another digital dust collector on my phone? The graveyard of abandoned productivity tools in my app drawer is a testament to my past failures.

I tried to set up my first ‘Zone’ for my Computer Science project. The drag-and-drop was intuitive, but then came the tags: ‘Quick Win,’ ‘Needs Brainpower,’ ‘Reminder Needed.’ My brain immediately seized up. **Analysis paralysis**. Which one is it? Is this a quick win if I can just *start* it? Or does it need brainpower because I’m so behind? The simple act of categorizing felt like another insurmountable task, and the **frustration** started to bubble. It’s like the app *almost* gets it, but then it asks me to make decisions my brain struggles with. I felt a familiar urge to just close the app, delete it, and go back to the comforting chaos of my own head.

Then, the ‘Coach Buddy’ popped up. A little animated character, cheerful, almost annoyingly so. It offered an ‘optional voice encouragement.’ My first thought was, *Oh great, another saccharine voice telling me to ‘just breathe.’* But I clicked it anyway, mostly out of morbid curiosity. The voice was… surprisingly not annoying. It suggested a ‘dopamine-boosting tip’ – ‘take three deep breaths, then stand up and stretch.’ My eyes rolled so hard I think I saw my brain. *This is it? This is the ‘brain-science-backed’ magic?* The **disappointment** was a dull ache. I’ve heard all this before. It’s the same generic advice, just wrapped in a prettier package. The hope, that tiny flicker I felt when I downloaded it, started to dim. I felt the familiar pull of my phone, the siren song of Reddit, promising an easier, less demanding escape. This app, despite its promises, felt like just another reminder of how broken my brain is, how even tools designed for me still can’t quite bridge the chasm between intention and action. The thought of having to *force* myself to use this, to make it work, was already exhausting. I’m tired of trying. I’m tired of failing. And I’m tired of being told to ‘just try harder’ in new, digital ways.




### Entry 3: After Using The Product

*November 20th, 2025*

It’s been a few weeks. I’m still surprised I haven’t deleted A-D-H-WHAT? yet. The first few days were a battle, honestly. I kept forgetting to use it, or I’d open it, feel that familiar **overwhelm** at the sheer *possibility* of organizing, and then just close it again. But then, the ‘Smart Reminders’ started. Not just generic pings, but little nudges that felt… different. One popped up during my usual 3 PM Reddit scroll: “Hey Liam, feeling that afternoon slump? Your ‘Needs Brainpower’ tasks are waiting. Maybe a quick ‘Quick Win’ first to get the momentum going?” It wasn’t accusatory. It was almost… understanding. And it was tied to my peak focus times, which somehow, the app seemed to know.

The real shift happened when I tried the Pomodoro timer with the ‘Coach Buddy’ again. This time, instead of just ‘breathe,’ it offered an ‘optional voice encouragement’ that was actually useful: “Remember, Liam, even 5 minutes of focused effort is a victory. Your brain thrives on novelty and small wins. Let’s get that dopamine flowing.” And then, after the 25 minutes, it suggested a ‘movement break’ – “Stand up, stretch, look out the window for 30 seconds. Get some sunlight.” It wasn’t just advice; it was *actionable*. And when I actually did it, I felt a subtle, almost imperceptible shift. A tiny spark of **relief**.

I started using the ‘Zones’ more. The color-coding, which initially felt like another chore, actually started to make sense. Seeing my tasks visually grouped by ‘School,’ ‘Chores,’ and ‘Personal Habits’ reduced the **overwhelm**. And the ‘AI suggestions based on your past habits’ – that’s where it got weirdly good. It started suggesting I tackle certain tasks when my energy levels were typically higher, or that I pair a ‘Needs Brainpower’ task with a ‘Quick Win’ to build momentum. It felt like the app was learning *my* brain, not just giving me generic advice. The **frustration** I usually feel when trying to organize began to recede, replaced by a strange sense of… **calm**.

I even tried the ‘AI journaling’ prompt one night when my brain was racing. It asked, “What’s one small victory you had today, and how did it make you feel?” Instead of the usual spiral of self-criticism, I found myself writing about finally submitting that difficult coding assignment, and the unexpected sense of pride. It was a tiny crack in the wall of **guilt** I usually carry. I’m not saying it’s perfect, or that my desk is suddenly spotless. But for the first time in a long time, I feel a glimmer of **confidence**. This isn’t just another checklist. It’s an accountability buddy that actually *gets* how my brain works. It’s not fighting me; it’s working *with* me. And that, for someone who’s been battling their own mind for years, is a profound, almost unbelievable **relief**. I’m still Liam, still a mess sometimes, but now… now I have a partner in the chaos. And that makes all the difference.
